Use Cases
Below is a high level description of common use cases. See also the Quick Start & Usage page.

Find Privesc Vectors (as Administrator)
When run with admin rights, windows-privesc-check has full read access to all secureable objects. This allows it to perform audits for escalation vectors such as:

Reconfiguring Windows Services
Replacing Service executables if they have weak file permissions
Replacing poorly protected .exe or .dll files in %ProgramFiles%
Tojaning the %PATH%
Maliciously modifying the registry (e.g. RunOnce)
Modifying programs on FAT file systems
Tampering with running processes
A great many of the privielges escalation vectors checked are simply checks for weak security descriptors on Windows securable objects.

A report is generated in HTML, TXT and XML format.

Find Privesc Vectors (as a Low-Privileged User)
An important design goal is that windows-privesc-check can perform as many checks as possible (above) without admin rights. This will make the tool useful to pentesters as well as auditors.

Clearly, low-privileged users are unable to see certain parts of the registry and file system. The tool is therefore inherently less able to identify security weaknesses when run as a low-privileged user.

As above, a report is generated in HTML, TXT and XML format.

Dump Raw Auditing Data
Windows-privesc-check can simply dump raw data that it would normally use to identify security weaknesses. This data can then analysed some other way - or simply stored as a snapshot of system security at the time of the audit.

Both human-readable (text) and machine readable (tab delimited) formats are supported.

Examples of data users are able to dump:

Detailed Share Information about local or remote systems. Includes DACL (Share permissions).
Information about users, groups, memeberships and the Windows Privileges (e.g. SeBackupPrivilege). See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb530716%28v=VS.85%29.aspx.
Provide Information To Help Compromise A Remote System
Given low-privileged credentials (or perhaps using anonymous access), windows-privesc-check should provide basic information which might help the user compromise the remote system. This might include:

Details of poorly configure shares
A list of admin-equivalent users
Information about its domain membership and the trusts configured for that domain
